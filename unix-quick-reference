# Unix Quick Reference

Terminology - all of these mean the same thing
  - Terminal
  - Shell
  - Bash
  - Command Line Interface (CLI)

general format: <command> <one or more arguments>
A lot of commands are very short, like abbreviations, in order to make it faster to type the command
   for example: cd for change directory
                pwd for print working directory

file commands:
     ls [-laTtrR]       # optional common single-letter argments.  Can be combined together
     cat [-n]          # view the contents of a file, optionally with line numbers
     more              # view the contents of a file with pagination
     head [-n <count>] <filename>.  # view the first <count> lines of a file, defaults to 10
     tail [-n <count>] <filename>.  # view the last <count> lines of a file
     touch <filename>     # create an empty file
     rm <filename>        # remove (delete) a file
     cp [-p] <source-filename> <destination-filename> # copy a file (make a duplicate)
     mv <source-filename> <destination-filename> # move (rename) a file
     wc -l                # count the number of lines in a file
    
directory commands:
     pwd              # print working directory
     mkdir <directory name> # make a new directory
     rmdir <directory name> # remove a directory
     cd               # with no argments means change to your home directory
     cd <directory>   # change directory to a specific directory
     cd ..            # go up one level
     mkdir <directory name>
    
how to use pipes and redirection
     <command> > <filename> # Redirect output to a file.  Create or overwrite the file
     <command> >> <filename> # Redirect output to a file.  create or append the file
     <command> | <command>   # Send the output of a command to another command
        example: ls -la | more
       
file permissons
     file permissions have the following three categories:
        u - user.  This is you
        g - group.  This is a group that you are in
        o - other.  Everyone else
     chmod  <mode> <filename> # changes the security permissions on a file or directory
        example: chmod ugo+rx syllabus.txt   # Allow anyone to read (view) the file
                 chmod go-rwx syllabus.txt   # Don'lt let anyone other than you get access to the file
     
Other commands:
     clear   # clear the screen
     date    # show the current date and time
     echo [<argument>] # just prints the argument
     which <filename>  # locate a program file in the user's path
     man  <command>    # read short documentation on the command.  Google is another way
     grep <pattern> <filename> # search a file for a pattern
     sort [<arguments> <filename> # sort a file
     uniq [-c | -d | -u] [-i] <filename> # show or fileter out repeated lines in a file. -i means ignore upper and lower case
     history # show the history of the commands you have used
     printenv  # show your environment variables
     crontab -l # show scheduled jobs - will cover this more in Bash shell programming
