# Learning to Program Syllabus
Revised: 2/19/2022

## Overview
* Learn to program from 1 to 4 programming languages
  1) Bash shell (not really a programming language but it can be programmed)
  2) awk
  3) Python
  4) Apple Swift 
      * write an app for the iPhone - very advanced
      * Must use a Macintosh and either an iPhone or an iPad
* This is best done using a Macintosh

## Outline
1. Create a GitHub account and put this syllabus on it
   * go to https://github.com and create an account
   * create a repository called Quick-Reference
     * create a README.md file
     * create a syllabus file and put this document in it

2. Unix shell commands
  * basic commands (some are listed below, but make a quick reference called unix-quick-reference
 ```
     general format: <command> <one or more arguments>
     ls
     ls -l
     ls -a
     ls -la
     cat
     more
     head
     tail
     pwd
     cd
     mkdir <directory name>
     touch <file name>
     how to use pipes
     man
     grep
     history
 ```
3) editors - there are different types of editors
     * vi and vim - basic general-purpose editors.  There are many editors in this category
     * sed
     * boop - Used to edit JSON files
     * IDE - Interactive Development Environment (we are not going to cover this unless we learn Apple Swift)

3) Bash shell programming

5) security
   * usernames and passwords
   * keys (public and private key pairs)
      - keys are *much* better security than username and password
   * multifactor authentication
      - something you know (eg a password)
      - something you have (eg a mobile phone)
   * How to securely store your passwords, financial, and other important data in an encrypted volume

4) awk programming language

5) Introduction to git and GitHub
  * This is just very introductory information
  * git and GitHub are very popular so it is useful to at least be aware of this
  * Putting your awk scripts on GitHub
  * getting someone else's awk scripts from GitHub

6) Python programming
  * two types of techniques
    * regular programming (we will cover this)
    * object-oriented programming (we are not going to cover this)

7) Swift programming language
   * Use this to write an app for the iPhone (very advanced)
